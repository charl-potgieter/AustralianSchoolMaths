### <span style="color:RGB(139,69,19)">  Notes </span>


* Can be utilised to prove a statement true for all positive integers, n
<BR><BR>
* Step 1: Show that the statement is true for n=1
<BR><BR>
* Step 2: Assume that the statement is true for some positive integer n = k
<BR><BR>
* Step 3: Using the assumption prove that the statement is also true for the next integer n=k+1
<BR><BR>
* Conclusion: State why the statement is true for all positive integers $n \ge 1$  Don't forget this!
<BR><BR>
* The conclusion can look like this :
    * The statement is true for n=k+1
    * The statement is true for n=1
    * Therefore by mathematical induction it is true for all integers $n \ge 1$
