#### Still need to complete the bulk of this section
The below is the section that is muddled in with Ch 8 Calculus


#### Multiple roots if polynomial equations

If P(x) = 0 has a multiple root at x=k then P(k) = P\(k) = 0<br>
*Proof of above*

If the multiplicity of r of a root is even <br>
&rarr; there is a minimum or maximum turning point at the multiple root.
<br><br>
If the multiplicity of r of a root is odd <br>
&rarr; there is a horizontal point of inflection the multiple root.
<br><br>
If P(x)=0 has a root at x=k with a multiplicity of r>1, then P'(x)=0 has a root of multiplicity of r-1<br>
*Proof of above*
