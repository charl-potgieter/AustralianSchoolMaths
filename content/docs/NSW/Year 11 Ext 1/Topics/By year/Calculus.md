#### Rates of change with respect to time



#### Exponential growth and decay



#### Related rates of change
If y is related to x, and x is related to time t, then the instantaneous rate of change of y with respect to time t utilises the chain rule: <br>
$\dfrac{dy}{dt} = \dfrac{dy}{dx} \times \dfrac{dx}{dt}$

#### Motion in a straight line
**Zero displacement**, when a particle is at the origin that is x = 0<br><br>
**Velocity** = rate of change of displacement, $v = \dot x = \dfrac{dx}{dt}$<br>
If a particle is moving to the right then velocity is positive, to the left velocity is negative<br>
Zero velocity = when a particle is not moving<br><br>
**Accelaration** = $a = \ddot x = \dfrac{dv}{dt}$<br>
Acceleration to the right is positive, to the left is negative. <br>
If acceleration is in the same direction as velocity then the particle is speeding up (accelerating) and vice versa.<br>
Zero acceleration  = the particle is not accelerating of deccelerating, that is it has a constant velocity.
