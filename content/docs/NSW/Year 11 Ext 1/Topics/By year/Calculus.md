#### Rates of change with respect to time



#### Exponential growth and decay



#### Related rates of change
If y is related to x, and x is related to time t, then the instantaneous rate of change of y with respect to time t utilises the chain rule: <br>
$\dfrac{dy}{dt} = \dfrac{dy}{dx} \times \dfrac{dx}{dt}$
