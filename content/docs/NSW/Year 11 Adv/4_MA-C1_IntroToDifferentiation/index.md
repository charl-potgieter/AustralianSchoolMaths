###   Notes 


#### Gradients and tangents

A function y=f(x) is differentiable at a point x= a if its graph is
 - continuous, and
 - smooth 
at x=a

The gradient of a secant drawn through 2 points on a curve approximates the gradient of a tangent where accuaracy improves as the distance between the point decreases

$\tan \theta = \text{ the gradient m}$

#### Difference quotients

Average rate of change of f(x) = gradient of chord of a secant $= \dfrac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}  $

#### The derivative function and its graph

$\dfrac{dy}{dx} = y' = f'(x) =\lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}  $

Graphing a derivative funcion f'(x):
 - f'(x) is zero at a stationary point of f(x)
 - f'(x) is positive when f(x) has a positive gradient
 - f'(x) is negative when f(x) has a negative gradient

The derivative at a point represents the instantaneous rate of change


#### Calculating with derivatives

See formulas below<br>

*Average rate of change* of quantity Q with respect to time t = $\dfrac{Q_2-Q_1}{t_2-t_1}$ 
<br><br>
*Instantaneous rate of change* of quantity Q with respect to time t = $\dfrac{dQ}{dt}$ 
<br><br>
*Displacement* measures the distance of an object from a fixed point or origin. Usually positive to the right of the point and negative to the left.
<br><br>
*Velocity* is the instantaneous rate of change of displacement x over time t = $v = \dfrac{dx}{dt}$, for example measured in km/h or $km^{-1}$
<br><br>
*Acceleration* is the instantaneous rate of change of velocity v over time t = $ a = \dfrac{dv}{dt}$, for example measured in km/h/h or $km h^{-2}$


#### Other notes

If two lines with gradients $m_1 \text{ and } m_2$ are perpendicular then $m_1 m_2 = -1$
