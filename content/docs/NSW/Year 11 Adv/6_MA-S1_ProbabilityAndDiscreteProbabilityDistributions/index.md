###   Notes 

 - Probability trees: Use the product rule along branches to find $P( A \cap B )$   representing A and B

 - Probability trees: Use the additional rule for different branches to find $P(A \cup B) $ representing A or B.

 - $A \cup B $ is A union B

 - $A \cap B $  is A intersection B

 - The probability formula applies where each outcome is equally likely: $ P(E) = \dfrac{n(E)}{n(S)} $

 - The sum of all mutually exclusive probabilities is 1

 - $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) $ is the addition rule for mutually exclusive events

 - $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) $ is the addition rule 

 - $P(A \cap B)  = P(A)P(B)$ is the product rule for independent events only

 - Conditional probability is $ P(A|B) = \dfrac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \text{, where } P(B) eq 0 $ while conditional probability for independent events is $ P(A|B) = P(A) $

 - Capital letter, e.g. X is often used for a random variable

 - Lower case letter such as x is used for the values of X

 - Properties of discrete probability distributions:
    * All possible value of X are mutually exclusive
    * The sum of probabilities = 1
    * For each value of x: 0<=P(X=x)<=1

 - A probability distribution can be drawn as a table with columns for x and P(x)

 - The expected values E(X) of a probability distribution measures the centre of the distribution  = mean or average
 - $\overline{x} $ is the mean of a sample

 - $\mu $ is the mean of the population

 - $s$ is the sample standard deviation

 - $\sigma$ is the poplulation standard deviation

 - As the sample size increases $\overline{x} $ approaches  $\mu $

 - The complement of A can be written as $\overline A$ or $ \text{A'}$ or $A^c$

 - The formula sheet defines variance as follows:  $ Var(X) = E(X^2) - \mu^2$.  The following may be an easier format to understand though: $ Var(X) = \sum[x^2p(x)] - \mu^2$
 
 - Know how to capture frequencies and calculate statistics on calculator
