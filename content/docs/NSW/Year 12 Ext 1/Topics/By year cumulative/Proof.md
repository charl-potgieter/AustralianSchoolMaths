### <span style="color:RGB(139,69,19)">  Notes </span>

 - Can be utilised to prove a statement true for all positive integers, n

 - Step 1: Show that the statement is true for n=1

 - Step 2: Assume that the statement is true for some positive integer n = k

 - Step 3: Using the assumption prove that the statement is also true for the next integer n=k+1

 - Conclusion: State why the statement is true for all positive integers $n \ge 1$  Don't forget this!

 - The conclusion can look like this :
    * The statement is true for n=k+1
    * The statement is true for n=1
    * Therefore by mathematical induction it is true for all integers $n \ge 1$
