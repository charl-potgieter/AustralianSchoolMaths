###   Concepts 

 - Bernoulli random variable
 - Binomial random variable
 - Bernoulli trial
 - Bernoulli distribution
 - Binomial distribution
 - population proportion
 - sample proportion
 - sampling distribution of proportions
 - central limit theorem



###   Notes 

 - Properties of binomial distribution:
    * fixed number of trials
    * there are only 2 outcomes: success or failure
    * each trial is independent
    * Probabilities are the same for each trial

 - Share of a binomial distribution:
    * p<0.5 : positively skewed
    * p=0.5 : normal / symmetrical
    * p>0.5 : negatively skewed
    
 - Be able to represent a Bernoulli distribution as a :
    * piecewise function
    * distribution table
    * bar chart
