###   Notes 

 - Vectors vs scalars

 - Triangle law of addition

 - Parallelogram law of addition

 - Subtracting vectors using the triangle rule

 - Subtracting vectors using the parallelogram rule

 - Adding and subtracting vectors numerically

 - Scalar multiplication

 - Magnitude of a position vector

 - Magnitude of a displacement vector

 - Direction of a position vector

 - Direction of a displacement vector

 - Direction measured by $\theta$, where $0^\circ \le \theta \le 360 ^\circ$.   Note that $\theta$ is never quoted as a negative given its domain.

 - $\theta = \dfrac{y}{x}$  Be careful as it is easy to get this the wrong way around given column vector notation quotes the x-value above the y-value.

 - Safest to draw a diagram when calculating $\theta$ to ensure it's value is in the correct quadrant.  

 - Don't confuse dot product $\underset{\sim}{u}.\underset{\sim}{v}$ and product of vector magnitudes $|\underset{\sim}{u}||\underset{\sim}{v}|$

 - Geometric proofs using vector examples

 - See formulas below for vectors parallel in like and unlike directions.  Also note vectors are parallel if one is a scalar multiple of another.

 - Length of vector x unit vector = the vector itself

 - Equal vectors have the same magnitude and direction but donâ€™t need to have the same position on the cartesian plane

 - Tip-to-tail addition of vectors can be applied to more than 2 vectors

 - Bearing is measured clockwise from north

 - Direction is measured anti-clockwise from  Easterly horizon

 - The path of projectile motion is a parabola

 - Acceleration due to gravity is the only acceleration that a projectile undergoes.  It can be subject to other velocity vectors though.

 - Note that it is useful to know below formulas but they cannot be used directly in any answers, they need to be derived from the gravity acceleration formula and the initial velocity formula

 - Projectile acceleration vector = $0\underset{\sim}{i}  +  -g\underset{\sim}{j}$

 - Projectile velocity vector = $v\cos\theta \underset{\sim}{i}  + (-gt + V \sin \theta) \underset{\sim}{j}$

 - Projectile displacement vector = $vt\cos\theta \underset{\sim}{i}  + (\dfrac{-gt^2}{2} + Vt \sin \theta) \underset{\sim}{j}$

 - Note from above that the horizontal component of the velocity vector is independent of time t, whereas the horizontal component of the displacement vector is dependent on t.

 - In order to calculate the velocity vector of a projectile :
    * Calculate the integral of the acceleration vector (where the variable of integtation is time = t).  The result includes a constant, say C
    * Get the initial velocity of the vector using $ v\cos\theta \underset{\sim}{i}  + v \sin \theta \underset{\sim}{j} $
    * Substitute above into the gravity velocity vector at time zero to solve for C

 - In order to calculate the displacement vector of a projectile :
    * Calculate the integral of the velocity vector which includes a constant, say D.  The velocity vector is as calculated above.
    * Get the displacement vector at time zero assuming horizontal component  = 0 = the start point and vertical component  = distance from vertical end point
    *  Substitute the above equations into one another to solve for the constant D

 - Projectile calculation notes :
    * Measure vertical displacement vector from where an object lands  - it should make no difference if measured from starting vertical point but ending vertical point is generally used if it is known
    * Measure horizontal displacement vector from starting point that is starting point =  zero horizontal displacement.  This is done as we generally dont know the ending point but in theory doesnt make a difference and end point may have to be used depending on question.
    * Speed  = magnitude of velocity vector at a specific time = $| \underset{\sim}{v} |$
    * Max height occurs when the vertical component of the velocity vector is zero
    * Max height is the vertical component of the displacement vector when the vertical component of the velocity vector is zero
    * Time of flight occurs when the vertical component of the displacement vector is zero
    * range of flight or horizontal range is the horizontal component of the displacement vector at the time that the vertical component of the displacement vector is zero
