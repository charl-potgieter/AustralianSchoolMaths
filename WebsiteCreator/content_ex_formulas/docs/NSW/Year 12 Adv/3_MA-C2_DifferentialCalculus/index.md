###   Notes 

#### Differentiation of trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic functions

Refer formulas below (the non-chain rule versions).  Note cases requiring proof.

**NB** The trig derivative rules work on radians, not degrees.  If a question is in degrees it first needs to be converted into radians.  Convert back to degrees in final step if required.

#### Rules of differentiation

Apply product, quotient and chain rules to differentiate the "simpler" versions of the function.

In particular note that $\tan x$ can be converted to $\dfrac{sin x}{cos x}$ and the quotient rule can then be applied.  Similiarly the quotient rule can be used to calculate $\sec x$ and $\cosec x$ by converting these into $\frac{1}{cos x}$ and $\frac{1}{sin x}$ respectively.

Use log laws to simplify expressions before differentiating.
