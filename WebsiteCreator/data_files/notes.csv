NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,Probability trees: Use the product rule along branches to find $P( A \cap B )$   representing A and B
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,Probability trees: Use the additional rule for different branches to find $P(A \cup B) $ representing A or B.
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,$A \cup B $ is A union B
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,$A \cap B $  is A intersection B
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,The probability formula applies where each outcome is equally likely: $ P(E) = \dfrac{n(E)}{n(S)} $
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,The sum of all mutually exclusive probabilities is 1
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) $ is the addition rule for mutually exclusive events
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) $ is the addition rule 
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,$P(A \cap B)  = P(A)P(B)$ is the product rule for independent events only
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,"Conditional probability is $ P(A|B) = \dfrac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \text{, where } P(B) eq 0 $ while conditional probability for independent events is $ P(A|B) = P(A) $"
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,"Capital letter, e.g. X is often used for a random variable"
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,Lower case letter such as x is used for the values of X
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,"Properties of discrete probability distributions:
    * All possible value of X are mutually exclusive
    * The sum of probabilities = 1
    * For each value of x: 0<=P(X=x)<=1"
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,A probability distribution can be drawn as a table with columns for x and P$($x$)$
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,The expected values E(X) of a probability distribution measures the centre of the distribution  = mean or average
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,$\overline{x} $ is the mean of a sample
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,$\mu $ is the mean of the population
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,$s$ is the sample standard deviation
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,$\sigma$ is the poplulation standard deviation
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,As the sample size increases $\overline{x} $ approaches  $\mu $
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,The complement of A can be written as $\overline A$ or $ \text{A'}$ or $A^c$
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,The formula sheet defines variance as follows:  $ Var(X) = E(X^2) - \mu^2$.  The following may be an easier format to understand though: $ Var(X) = \sum[x^2p(x)] - \mu^2$
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,Know how to capture frequencies and calculate statistics on calculator
NSW,Year 11 Ext 1,ME-A1,$ n!$ is the number of ways of selecting n objects with no replacement or repetition.  Order is important.
NSW,Year 11 Ext 1,ME-A1,Permutations = ordered
NSW,Year 11 Ext 1,ME-A1,$^nP_r$ is the number of ways of making an ordered selection or r objects from a total of n objects.
NSW,Year 11 Ext 1,ME-A1,"Combinations = unordered.  Given the order is not important, therefore will be a smaller number than the equivalent permutation."
NSW,Year 11 Ext 1,ME-A1,$^nC_r = (^n_r)$ is the number of ways of making an unordered selection or r objects from a total of n objects.
NSW,Year 11 Ext 1,ME-A1,"When calculating how many ways items can be arranged in a circle e.g. table, necklace:
    * questions assume position of items in a circle is irrelevant
    * item appearing at the top of the circle vs the bottom of the circle is the same thing for example
    * Therefore n items can be arranged around a circle in (n-1)! ways, as the positioning of the first item is irrelevant"
NSW,Year 11 Ext 1,ME-A1,"When x items in an arrangement need to be together / consecutive, treat these as one item, and make the corresponding reduction to n.
     * For example when 5 different colour balls need to be arranged but red and yellow need to be next to each other than the number of arrangements is 4! treating the red and yellow as one.
     * But these x objects can be arranged in x! ways, in above case 2!
    * Therefore total arrangements  = 4! x 2!"
NSW,Year 11 Ext 1,ME-A1,"Be on the lookout for the options in the ""other"" part of the arrangement.
    * For example if questions asks how many ways can 3 people sit next to each other at a table of 7 people:
    * The 3 people can sit next to each other in 3! ways  - where they sit on round table is irrelevant
    * Don’t forget that the other 4 people can sit next to each other in 4! different ways
    * Therefore 3! x 4!"
NSW,Year 11 Ext 1,ME-A1,Each item in Pascals triangle can be written as $^{\text{row index}}C_{\text{column index}}$ where both the indices start from zero.
NSW,Year 11 Ext 1,ME-A1,To satisfy oneself as to workings of binomial expansion it can be quickly tested with something simple like $(a+b)^2$
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,Categorical data can be nominal or ordinal
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,Numerical data can be discrete or continuous
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,"Displaying numerical data:
    *Frequency table
    * histogram $($centre of column is lined up with value on x-axis.  No gap between columns$)$ 
    * frequency polygon $($line graph displaying frequency, starts and ends on x-axis$)$ 
    * cumulative frequency histogram 
    * ogive $($cumulative frequency polygon$)$ 
    * stem and leaf plot $[$graphical display of tens $($stems$)$ and units $($leaves$)]$
    * dot plot
    * five-number summary
    * box plot $($box-and-whisker-plot$)$"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,  ,"Displaying categorical data:
    * Two way table
    * Bar chart $($there are gaps between columns, unlike the histogram$)$
    * Pie chart
    * Pareto chart $($bar chart of frequencies in descending order.  No gaps.  Non cumulative.   + Cumulative percentage frequency line graph starting at 0% on left and ending with 100% on right.  Two y-axis: frequency units on left and cumulative percentage frequency on the right$)$"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,"3 Measures of central tendency:
    * mean
    * mode
    * median"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,"If ranges are provided in a frequency table a class centre will generally need to be added as an additional column in order to calculate statistics such as mean, standard deviation etc."
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,Grouped data has a modal class rather than a mode
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,"If there are two middle values. In other words an even number of values, the median is the average of these values."
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,The median on an ogive is the halfway point on the cumulative frequency axis
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,"Recommended, but not universal, method for computing quartiles:
    * Use the median to divide the ordered set into 2 halves.  
    * If there is an odd number in the original set then do not include the median in either half.
    * If there is an even number in the original set then split the set exactly in half
    * Q1 and Q3 are the medians of the lower and upper halves respectively"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,"Quantile is a general term, quartiles divide set into 4 parts, deciles into 10 parts and percentiles into 100 parts"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,"Shapes of data: 
    * negatively skewed = more area to left of the centre = the tail points to low scores
    * positively skewed = more area to the right of the centre = the tail points to high scores
    * symmetrical"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,"Modality of data:
    * unimodal  = 1 peak
    * bimodal  = 2 peaks
    * multimodal = has many peaks"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,Scatterplots are used to graph bivariate data

NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,Need to be able to calculate least squares regression line on a calculator but don’t need to be able to manually calculate with formula
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S3,The cumulative distribution function is the integral of the probability density function
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S3,A continuous probability distribution is reported by a probability density function
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S3,"The probability of a single outcome of a continuous probability distribution cannot be calculated, in other words $P(X=x) = 0$.  The probability can only be calculated for a range"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S3,"Given $P(X=a) = 0$ and $P(X=b) = 0$, therefore $P(a < X < b) = P(a \leq X \leq b)$"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S3,The area under a probability density function is 1 : $ {\Large\int}^\infty_{-\infty} f(x)dx = 1$
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S3,"Given probability density function $f(x)$ over domain [a,b] and cumulative distribution function $F(x)$ $F(a) = 0$ and $F(b) = 1$"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S3,"The median lies at point x where ${\Large\int}^x_a f(x)dx = \dfrac{1}{2}$ where $f(x)$ is a pdf defined on domain [a,b].  Alternatively $F(x)-F(a) = \dfrac{1}{2}$ Similiar rules apply to other quantiles."
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S3,"The mean, mode, and median are equal for a normal distribution"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S3,"Finding probability by integration in a normal distribution is complex, therefore use tables where $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$"
NSW,Year 12 Ext 1,ME-S1,"Properties of binomial distribution:
    * fixed number of trials
    * there are only 2 outcomes: success or failure
    * each trial is independent
    * Probabilities are the same for each trial"
NSW,Year 12 Ext 1,ME-S1,"Share of a binomial distribution:
