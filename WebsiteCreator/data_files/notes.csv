NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,Probability trees: Use the product rule along branches to find $P( A \cap B )$   representing A and B
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,Probability trees: Use the additional rule for different branches to find $P(A \cup B) $ representing A or B.
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,$A \cup B $ is A union B
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,$A \cap B $  is A intersection B
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,The probability formula applies where each outcome is equally likely: $ P(E) = \dfrac{n(E)}{n(S)} $
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,The sum of all mutually exclusive probabilities is 1
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,$A \cup B = P(A) + P(B) $ is the addition rule for mutually exclusive events
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,$A \cup B = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) $ is the addition rule 
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,$A \cap B  = P(A)P(B)$ is the product rule for independent events only
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,"Conditional probability is $ P(A|B) = \dfrac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \text{, where } P(B) eq 0 $ while conditional probability for independent events is $ P(A|B) = P(A) $"
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,"Capital letter, e.g. X is often used for a random variable"
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,Lower case letter such as x is used for the values of X
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,"Properties of discrete probability distributions:
    * All possible value of X are mutually exclusive
    * The sum of probabilities = 1
    * For each value of x: 0<=P(X=x)<=1"
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,A probability distribution can be drawn as a table with columns for x and P$($x$)$
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,The expected values E(X) of a probability distribution measures the centre of the distribution  = mean or average
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,$\overline{x} $ is the mean of a sample
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,$\mu $ is the mean of the population
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,$s$ is the sample standard deviation
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,$\sigma$ is the poplulation standard deviation
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,As the sample size increases $\overline{x} $ approaches  $\mu $
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,The complement of A can be written as $\overline A$ or $ \text{A'}$ or $A^c$
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,The formula sheet defines variance as follows:  $ Var(X) = E(X^2) - \mu^2$.  The following may be an easier format to understand though: $ Var(X) = \sum[x^2p(x)] - \mu^2$
NSW,Year 11 Adv,MA-S1,Know how to capture frequencies and calculate statistics on calculator
NSW,Year 11 Ext 1,ME-A1,$ n!$ is the number of ways of selecting n objects with no replacement or repetition.
NSW,Year 11 Ext 1,ME-A1,Permutations = ordered
NSW,Year 11 Ext 1,ME-A1,$^nP_r$ is the number of ways of making an ordered selection or r objects from a total of n objects.
NSW,Year 11 Ext 1,ME-A1,"Combinations = unordered.  Given the order is not important, therefore will be a smaller number than the equivalent permutation."
NSW,Year 11 Ext 1,ME-A1,$^nC_r = (^n_r)$ is the number of ways of making an unordered selection or r objects from a total of n objects.
NSW,Year 11 Ext 1,ME-A1,Each item in Pascals triangle can be written as $^{\text{row index}}C_{\text{column index}}$ where both the indices start from zero.
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,Categorical data can be nominal or ordinal
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,Numerical data can be discrete or continuous
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,"Displaying numerical data:
    *Frequency table
    * histogram $($centre of column is lined up with value on x-axis.  No gap between columns$)$ 
    * frequency polygon $($line graph displaying frequency, starts and ends on x-axis$)$ 
    * cumulative frequency histogram 
    * ogive $($cumulative frequency polygon$)$ 
    * stem and leaf plot $[$graphical display of tens $($stems$)$ and units $($leaves$)]$
    * dot plot
    * five-number summary
    * box plot $($box-and-whisker-plot$)$"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,  ,"Displaying categorical data:
    * Two way table
    * Bar chart $($there are gaps between columns, unlike the histogram$)$
    * Pie chart
    * Pareto chart $($bar chart of frequencies in descending order.  No gaps.  Non cumulative.   + Cumulative percentage frequency line graph starting at 0% on left and ending with 100% on right.  Two y-axis: frequency units on left and cumulative percentage frequency on the right$)$"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,"3 Measures of central tendency:
    * mean
    * mode
    * median"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,"If ranges are provided in a frequency table a class centre will generally need to be added as an additional column in order to calculate statistics such as mean, standard deviation etc."
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,Grouped data has a modal class rather than a mode
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,"If there are two middle values. In other words an even number of values, the median is the average of these values."
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,The median on an ogive is the halfway point on the cumulative frequency axis
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,"Recommended, but not universal, method for computing quartiles:
    * Use the median to divide the ordered set into 2 halves.  
    * If there is an odd number in the original set then do not include the median in either half.
    * If there is an even number in the original set then split the set exactly in half
    * Q1 and Q3 are the medians of the lower and upper halves respectively"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,"Quantile is a general term, quartiles divide set into 4 parts, deciles into 10 parts and percentiles into 100 parts"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,"Shapes of data: 
    * negatively skewed = more data to left of the centre
    * positively skewed = more data to the right of the centre
    * symmetrical"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,"Modality of data:
    * unimodal  = 1 peak
    * bimodal  = 2 peaks
    * multimodal = has many peaks"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,Scatterplots are used to graph bivariate data
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,"Scatterplots can be:
    * linear
    * non-linear
    * have no shape"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,Don't need to utilise a formula to calculate Pearson's correlation co-efficient $($r$)$ but need to be able to calculate using calculator
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,"Values of  Pearson's correlation co-efficient $($r$)$:
    * $ -1 \le r \le 1$
    * $ 0 \le r \le 1$ &emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;  scatterplot with positive direction
    * $r=1$ &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; perfect positive correlation 
    * $ -1 \le r \le 0$ &ensp;&nbsp; scatterplot with negative direction 
    * $r=-1$ &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; perfect negative correlation
    * $r=0$ &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; no correlation"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S2,Need to be able to calculate least squares regression line on a calculator but don’t need to be able to manually calculate with formula
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S3,The cumulative distribution function is the integral of the probability density function
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S3,A continuous probability distribution is reported by a probability density function
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S3,"The probability of a single outcome of a continuous probability distribution cannot be calculated, in other words P(X=x) = 0.  The probability can only be calculated for a range"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S3,"Given $P(X=a) = 0$ and $P(X=b) = 0$, therefore $P(a < X < b) = P(a \leq X \leq b)$"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S3,The area under a probability density function is 1 : $ {\Large\int}^\infty_{-\infty} f(x)dx = 1$
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S3,"Given probability density function $f(x)$ over domain [a,b] and cumulative distribution function $F(x)$ $F(a) = 0$ and $F(b) = 1$"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S3,"The median lies at point x where ${\Large\int}^x_a f(x)dx = \dfrac{1}{2}$ where $f(x)$ is a pdf defined on domaimn [a,b].  Similiar rules apply to other quantiles."
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S3,"The mean, mode, and median are equal for a normal distribution"
NSW,Year 12 Adv,MA-S3,"Finding probability by integration in a normal distribution is complex, therefore use tables where $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$"
