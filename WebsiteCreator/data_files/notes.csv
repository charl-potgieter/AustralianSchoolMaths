NSW,MA-S1,Probability trees: Use the product rule along branches to find $P( A \cap B )$   representing A and B
NSW,MA-S1,Probability trees: Use the additional rule for different branches to find $P(A \cup B) $ representing A or B.
NSW,MA-S1,$A \cup B $ is A union B
NSW,MA-S1,$A \cap B $  is A intersection B
NSW,MA-S1,The probability formula applies where each outcome is equally likely: $ P(E) = \dfrac{n(E)}{n(S)} $
NSW,MA-S1,The sum of all mutually exclusive probabilities is 1
NSW,MA-S1,$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) $ is the addition rule for mutually exclusive events
NSW,MA-S1,$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) $ is the addition rule 
NSW,MA-S1,$P(A \cap B)  = P(A)P(B)$ is the product rule for independent events only
NSW,MA-S1,"Conditional probability is $ P(A|B) = \dfrac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \text{, where } P(B) eq 0 $ while conditional probability for independent events is $ P(A|B) = P(A) $"
NSW,MA-S1,"Capital letter, e.g. X is often used for a random variable"
NSW,MA-S1,Lower case letter such as x is used for the values of X
NSW,MA-S1,"Properties of discrete probability distributions:
    * All possible value of X are mutually exclusive
    * The sum of probabilities = 1
    * For each value of x: 0<=P(X=x)<=1"
NSW,MA-S1,A probability distribution can be drawn as a table with columns for x and P$($x$)$
NSW,MA-S1,The expected values E(X) of a probability distribution measures the centre of the distribution  = mean or average
NSW,MA-S1,$\overline{x} $ is the mean of a sample
NSW,MA-S1,$\mu $ is the mean of the population
NSW,MA-S1,$s$ is the sample standard deviation
NSW,MA-S1,$\sigma$ is the poplulation standard deviation
NSW,MA-S1,As the sample size increases $\overline{x} $ approaches  $\mu $
NSW,MA-S1,The complement of A can be written as $\overline A$ or $ \text{A'}$ or $A^c$
NSW,MA-S1,The formula sheet defines variance as follows:  $ Var(X) = E(X^2) - \mu^2$.  The following may be an easier format to understand though: $ Var(X) = \sum[x^2p(x)] - \mu^2$
NSW,MA-S1,Know how to capture frequencies and calculate statistics on calculator
NSW,ME-A1,$ n!$ is the number of ways of selecting n objects with no replacement or repetition.  Order is important.
NSW,ME-A1,Permutations = ordered
NSW,ME-A1,$^nP_r$ is the number of ways of making an ordered selection or r objects from a total of n objects.
NSW,ME-A1,"Combinations = unordered.  Given the order is not important, therefore will be a smaller number than the equivalent permutation."
NSW,ME-A1,$^nC_r = (^n_r)$ is the number of ways of making an unordered selection or r objects from a total of n objects.
NSW,ME-A1,"When calculating how many ways items can be arranged in a circle e.g. table, necklace:
    * questions assume position of items in a circle is irrelevant
    * item appearing at the top of the circle vs the bottom of the circle is the same thing for example
    * Therefore n items can be arranged around a circle in (n-1)! ways, as the positioning of the first item is irrelevant"
NSW,ME-A1,"When x items in an arrangement need to be together / consecutive, treat these as one item, and make the corresponding reduction to n.
     * For example when 5 different colour balls need to be arranged but red and yellow need to be next to each other than the number of arrangements is 4! treating the red and yellow as one.
     * But these x objects can be arranged in x! ways, in above case 2!
    * Therefore total arrangements  = 4! x 2!"
NSW,ME-A1,"Be on the lookout for the options in the ""other"" part of the arrangement.
    * For example if questions asks how many ways can 3 people sit next to each other at a table of 7 people:
    * The 3 people can sit next to each other in 3! ways  - where they sit on round table is irrelevant
    * Don’t forget that the other 4 people can sit next to each other in 4! different ways
    * Therefore 3! x 4!"
NSW,ME-A1,Each item in Pascals triangle can be written as $^{\text{row index}}C_{\text{column index}}$ where both the indices start from zero.
NSW,ME-A1,To satisfy oneself as to workings of binomial expansion it can be quickly tested with something simple like $(a+b)^2$
NSW,MA-S2,Categorical data can be nominal or ordinal
NSW,MA-S2,Numerical data can be discrete or continuous
NSW,MA-S2,"Displaying numerical data:
    *Frequency table
    * histogram $($centre of column is lined up with value on x-axis.  No gap between columns$)$ 
    * frequency polygon $($line graph displaying frequency, starts and ends on x-axis$)$ 
    * cumulative frequency histogram 
    * ogive $($cumulative frequency polygon$)$ 
    * stem and leaf plot $[$graphical display of tens $($stems$)$ and units $($leaves$)]$
    * dot plot
    * five-number summary
    * box plot $($box-and-whisker-plot$)$"
NSW,  ,"Displaying categorical data:
    * Two way table
    * Bar chart $($there are gaps between columns, unlike the histogram$)$
    * Pie chart
    * Pareto chart $($bar chart of frequencies in descending order.  No gaps.  Non cumulative.   + Cumulative percentage frequency line graph starting at 0% on left and ending with 100% on right.  Two y-axis: frequency units on left and cumulative percentage frequency on the right$)$"
NSW,MA-S2,"3 Measures of central tendency:
    * mean
    * mode
    * median"
NSW,MA-S2,"If ranges are provided in a frequency table a class centre will generally need to be added as an additional column in order to calculate statistics such as mean, standard deviation etc."
NSW,MA-S2,Grouped data has a modal class rather than a mode
NSW,MA-S2,"If there are two middle values. In other words an even number of values, the median is the average of these values."
NSW,MA-S2,The median on an ogive is the halfway point on the cumulative frequency axis
NSW,MA-S2,"Recommended, but not universal, method for computing quartiles:
    * Use the median to divide the ordered set into 2 halves.  
    * If there is an odd number in the original set then do not include the median in either half.
    * If there is an even number in the original set then split the set exactly in half
    * Q1 and Q3 are the medians of the lower and upper halves respectively"
NSW,MA-S2,"Quantile is a general term, quartiles divide set into 4 parts, deciles into 10 parts and percentiles into 100 parts"
NSW,MA-S2,"Shapes of data: 
    * negatively skewed = more area to left of the centre = the tail points to low scores
    * positively skewed = more area to the right of the centre = the tail points to high scores
    * symmetrical"
NSW,MA-S2,"Modality of data:
    * unimodal  = 1 peak
    * bimodal  = 2 peaks
    * multimodal = has many peaks"
NSW,MA-S2,Scatterplots are used to graph bivariate data
NSW,MA-S2,"Scatterplots can be:
    * linear
    * non-linear
    * have no shape"
NSW,MA-S2,Don't need to utilise a formula to calculate Pearson's correlation co-efficient $($r$)$ but need to be able to calculate using calculator
NSW,MA-S2,"Values of  Pearson's correlation co-efficient $($r$)$:
    * $ -1 \le r \le 1$
    * $ 0 \le r \le 1$ &emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;  scatterplot with positive direction

    * $r=-1$ &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; perfect negative correlation
    * $r=0$ &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; no correlation"
NSW,MA-S2,Need to be able to calculate least squares regression line on a calculator but don’t need to be able to manually calculate with formula
NSW,MA-S3,The cumulative distribution function is the integral of the probability density function
NSW,MA-S3,A continuous probability distribution is reported by a probability density function
NSW,MA-S3,"The probability of a single outcome of a continuous probability distribution cannot be calculated, in other words $P(X=x) = 0$.  The probability can only be calculated for a range"
NSW,MA-S3,"Given $P(X=a) = 0$ and $P(X=b) = 0$, therefore $P(a < X < b) = P(a \leq X \leq b)$"
NSW,MA-S3,The area under a probability density function is 1 : $ {\Large\int}^\infty_{-\infty} f(x)dx = 1$
NSW,MA-S3,"Given probability density function $f(x)$ over domain [a,b] and cumulative distribution function $F(x)$ $F(a) = 0$ and $F(b) = 1$"
NSW,MA-S3,"The median lies at point x where ${\Large\int}^x_a f(x)dx = \dfrac{1}{2}$ where $f(x)$ is a pdf defined on domain [a,b].  Alternatively $F(x)-F(a) = \dfrac{1}{2}$ Similiar rules apply to other quantiles."
NSW,MA-S3,"The mean, mode, and median are equal for a normal distribution"
NSW,MA-S3,"Finding probability by integration in a normal distribution is complex, therefore use tables where $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$"
NSW,ME-S1,"Properties of binomial distribution:
    * fixed number of trials
    * there are only 2 outcomes: success or failure
    * each trial is independent
    * Probabilities are the same for each trial"
NSW,ME-S1,"Share of a binomial distribution:
    * p<0.5 : positively skewed
    * p=0.5 : normal / symmetrical

NSW,MEX-N1,Multiply complex numbers by a constant
NSW,MEX-N1,"Tip: If a question provides 2 complex roots of a quadratic, it is simpler to substitute symbols for the roots such as a and b e.g. $(x-a)(x-b)  = 0$ and then multiply out before inserting the complex numbers"
NSW,MEX-N1,Be able to factorise a quadratic as a difference of squares by adding an $i^2$ to one of the sides in place of a minus one.
NSW,MEX-N1,"Complex numbers can be written in :
    * cartesian or rectangular form
    * polar of modulus-argument form
    * exponential form"
NSW,MEX-N1,Writing complex numbers in exponential form enables the use of index laws that can simplify calculations
NSW,ME-P1,"Can be utilised to prove a statement true for all positive integers, n"
NSW,ME-P1,Step 1: Show that the statement is true for n=1
NSW,ME-P1,Step 2: Assume that the statement is true for some positive integer n = k
NSW,ME-P1,Step 3: Using the assumption prove that the statement is also true for the next integer n=k+1
NSW,ME-P1,Conclusion: State why the statement is true for all positive integers $n \ge 1$  Don't forget this!
NSW,ME-P1,"The conclusion can look like this :
    * The statement is true for n=k+1
    * The statement is true for n=1
    * Therefore by mathematical induction it is true for all integers $n \ge 1$"

NSW,ME-V1,The path of projectile motion is a parabola
NSW,ME-V1,Acceleration due to gravity is the only acceleration that a projectile undergoes.  It can be subject to other velocity vectors though.
NSW,ME-V1,"Note that it is useful to know below formulas but they cannot be used directly in any answers, they need to be derived from the gravity acceleration formula and the initial velocity formula"
NSW,ME-V1,Projectile acceleration vector = $0\underset{\sim}{i}  +  -g\underset{\sim}{j}$
NSW,ME-V1,Projectile velocity vector = $v\cos\theta \underset{\sim}{i}  + (-gt + V \sin \theta) \underset{\sim}{j}$
NSW,ME-V1,Projectile displacement vector = $vt\cos\theta \underset{\sim}{i}  + (\dfrac{-gt^2}{2} + Vt \sin \theta) \underset{\sim}{j}$
NSW,ME-V1,"Note from above that the horizontal component of the velocity vector is independent of time t, whereas the horizontal component of the displacement vector is dependent on t."
NSW,ME-V1,"In order to calculate the velocity vector of a projectile :
    * Calculate the integral of the acceleration vector which includes a constant, say C
    * Get the initial velocity of the vector using $ v\cos\theta \underset{\sim}{i}  + v \sin \theta \underset{\sim}{j} $
    * Substitute above into the gravity velocity vector at time zero to solve for C"
NSW,ME-V1,"In order to calculate the displacement vector of a projectile :
    * Calculate the integral of the velocity vector which includes a constant, say D.  The velocity vector is as calculated above.
    * Get the displacement vector at time zero assuming horizontal component  = 0 = the start point and vertical component  = distance from vertical end point
    *  Substitute the above equations into one another to solve for the constant D"
NSW,ME-V1,"Projectile calculation notes :
    * Measure vertical displacement vector from where an object lands
    * Measure horizontal displacement vector from starting point that is starting point =  zero horizontal displacement
    * Speed  = magnitude of velocity vector at a specific time = $| \underset{\sim}{v} |$
    * Max height occurs when the vertical component of the velocity vector is zero
    * Max height is the vertical component of the displacement vector when the vertical component of the velocity vector is zero
    * Time of flight occurs when the vertical component of the displacement vector is zero
    * range of flight or horizontal range is the horizontal component of the displacement vector at the time that the vertical component of the displacement vector is zero"
