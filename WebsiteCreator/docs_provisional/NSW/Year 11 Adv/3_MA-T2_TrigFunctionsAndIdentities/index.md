## Trigonometric Functions and Identities

###   Concepts 

 - identity


###   Notes 


**Reciprocal trigonometric functions**
Refer formulas below for cosececant (cosec or csc), secant(sec) and cotangent(cot).

Note how $\cot A = \frac{\cos A}{\sin A}, \sin A \ne 0$, which is effectively $\frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{opposite}}$ **not** $\frac{1}{\tan A}$.  This is important as tan A is undefined at odd multiples of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ while cot A is zero.  This concept must also be understood when graphing cot A given that cot A has different assymptotes to tan A.


**Pythagorean identities**
<br>
An identity is true for all values of the variable, as opposed to an equation which is only true for a certain number(s).
 - $\cos^2 x+\sin^2 x = 1$
 - $1+\tan^2 x = \sec^2 x$
 - $\cot^2 x+1 = \text{cosec }^2 x$

Note only the first identity appears on the formula sheet.  As alternative to memorising the 2nd and 3rd identity above they can be derived by dividing the first indentity by $\cos^2 x$ and $sin^2 x$ respectively.

**Complementary angles**
<br>
Complementary angles add up to 90 degrees (vs supsupplementary angles which add up to 180 degrees) <br>
Formulas such as $\sin \theta = \cos (90^{\circ} - \theta)$ are included in formulas below. <br>

As an alternative to memorising the complementary angle identities can be derived from a triangle such as below.  Worthwhile memorising the sin and cos related formulas at a minimum though.

**y=cosec(x)**
 - domain = $(-\infty , \infty )$, except for multiples of $\pi$
 - range = $(-\infty , -1] \cup  [1, \infty) $
 - It is an odd function, -f(x) = f(-x)

**y=sec(x)**
 - domain = $(-\infty , \infty)$, except for odd multiples of $\frac{\pi}{2}$
 - range = $(-\infty , -1] \cup  [1, \infty) $
 - It is an even function, f(x) = f(-x)

**y=cot(x)**
 - domain = $(-\infty , \infty )$, except for multiples of $\pi$ (asymptotes exist at these x-values)
 - range = $(-\infty , \infty )$
 - It is an odd function, f(x) = f(-x)

When solving trigonometric expressions within a domain remember that domain
refers to the domain of the x values, therefore if solving something like
$\sin 2x = \frac{1}{2}$ for a range of $[0^\circ, 360^\circ]$ solutions first need to
be found for $2x$ within the range of $[0^\circ, 720^\circ]$
