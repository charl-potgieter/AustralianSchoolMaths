    "#### Differentiability\n",
    "\n",
    "A function y=f(x) is differentiable at a point x= a if its graph is\n",
    " - continuous, and\n",
    " - smooth \n",
    "\n",
    "at x=a\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Differentiation from 1st principles\n",
    "\n",
    "When 2 points are taken very close together on a curve, the gradient of the secant of these 2 points is very close to the gradient of the tangent at one of these points, which is called the instantaneous rate of change.\n",
    "\n",
    "$f'(x) =\\lim\\limits_{h \\to 0} \\dfrac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}  $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Short methods of differentiation\n",
    "See formulas below<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: If two lines with gradients $m_1 \\text{ and } m_2$ are perpendicular then $m_1 m_2 = -1$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The chain rule\n",
    "If a function can be written as a composite function where $y = f(u(x))$ then $\\dfrac{dy}{dx} = \\dfrac{dy}{du} \\times \\dfrac{du}{dx}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other rules\n",
    "See formulas listed below\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rates of change\n",
    "\n",
    "*Average rate of change* of quantity Q with respect to time t = $\\dfrac{Q_2-Q_1}{t_2-t_1}$ \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "*Instantaneous rate of change* of quantity Q with respect to time t = $\\dfrac{dQ}{dt}$ \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "*Displacement* measures the distance of an object from a fixed point or origin. Usually positive to the right of the point and negative to the left. <br>\n",
    "*Velocity* is the instantaneous rate of change of displacement x over time t = $v = \\dfrac{dx}{dt}$, for example measured in km/h or $km^{-1}$"
