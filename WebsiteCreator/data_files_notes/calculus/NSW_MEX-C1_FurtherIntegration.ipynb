    "#### Integration by substitution\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an extension of this topic as covered in Year 12 Ext 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    " - When substituting with say $u=\\sqrt{x}$ it is not necessary to replace every single $\\sqrt{x}$ with u.  One of the cases can be left as $\\sqrt{x}$ to cross cancel with value in the \"derivative\" portion of the equation, for exmple where $dx = 5 \\sqrt{x}$  \n",
    " \n",
    " - Before jumping into substitution (or another integation method) consider any other simplifications that can be made to the expression requiring integration for example\n",
    "    - factorising and simplifing fractions, e.g. via difference of squares\n",
    "    - trig identities e.g. $\\sin^2 nx = \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\cos 2nx)$ and $\\cos^2 nx = \\frac{1}{2}(1+\\cos 2nx)$\n",
    "\n",
    " - When using the t-formula subsitutions $t = \\tan \\frac{x}{2}$ as per patterns below it is worthwhile remembering that when calculating dx it needs to equal $\\dfrac{2dt}{1+t^2}$\n",

    "#### Integration of rational functions involving a quadratic denominator\n",
    "\n",
    " Rational functions are functions where both the numerator and denominator are polynomials.\n",
    " \n",
    " Possible approaches:\n",
    "  - Dont overlook simple options such as factorising and simplifying fractions that may remove the quadratic denominator.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - If the integrand can be restated as $\\dfrac{1}{(x+a)^2}$ the result of the integral calculation is simply $- \\dfrac{1}{x+a}$\n",
    "  \n",
    " - If the integrand can be transformed into one of the below forms, for examply by completing the square, the inverse sin and inverse tan integration rules can be applied respectively:\n",
    "   - $\\dfrac{f'(x)}{\\sqrt{a^2-[f(x)]^2}}$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   - $\\dfrac{f'(x)}{a^2+[f(x)]^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    " - Look for integrands in the form of $\\dfrac{f'(x)}{f{x}}$ that when integrated yield $ln|f(x)| + c$\n",
    "\n",
    " - if the numerator consists of 2 terms, the fraction may be able to be split into 2 fractions which may match one of the patterns above.\n",
    "\n",
    " - As an extension of above step, sometimes additional values can be added to and then subtracted from the numerator to enable the single fraction to be split into two that intergtate more easily, for exmple $\\dfrac {x^2}{x^2+1} = \\dfrac{x^2+1-1}{x^2+1} = 1 - \\dfrac{1}{x^2+1}$\n",
