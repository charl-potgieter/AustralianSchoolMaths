    "#### Integration by substitution\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an extension of this topic as covered in Year 12 Ext 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    " - When substituting with say $u=\\sqrt{x}$ it is not necessary to replace every single $\\sqrt{x}$ with u.  One of the cases can be left as $\\sqrt{x}$ to cross cancel with value in the \"derivative\" portion of the equation, for exmple where $dx = 5 \\sqrt{x}$  \n",
    " \n",
    " - Before jumping into substitution (or another integation method) consider any other simplifications that can be made to the expression requiring integration for example\n",
    "    - factorising and simplifing fractions, e.g. via difference of squares\n",
    "    - trig identities e.g. $\\sin^2 nx = \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\cos 2nx)$ and $\\cos^2 nx = \\frac{1}{2}(1+\\cos 2nx)$\n",
    "\n",
    " - When using the t-formula subsitutions $t = \\tan \\frac{x}{2}$ as per patterns below it is worthwhile remembering that when calculating dx it needs to equal $\\dfrac{2dt}{1+t^2}$\n",

    "#### Integration of rational functions involving a quadratic denominator\n",
    "\n",
    " Rational functions are functions where both the numerator and denominator are polynomials.\n",
    " \n",
    " Possible approaches:\n",
    "  - Dont overlook simple options such as factorising and simplifying fractions that may remove the quadratic denominator.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - If the integrand can be restated as $\\dfrac{1}{(x+a)^2}$ the result of the integral calculation is simply $- \\dfrac{1}{x+a}$\n",
    "  \n",
    " - If the integrand can be transformed into one of the below forms, for examply by completing the square, the inverse sin and inverse tan integration rules can be applied respectively:\n",
    "   - $\\dfrac{f'(x)}{\\sqrt{a^2-[f(x)]^2}}$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   - $\\dfrac{f'(x)}{a^2+[f(x)]^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    " - Look for integrands in the form of $\\dfrac{f'(x)}{f{x}}$ that when integrated yield $ln|f(x)| + c$\n",
    "\n",
    " - if the numerator consists of 2 terms, the fraction may be able to be split into 2 fractions which may match one of the patterns above.\n",
    "\n",
    " - As an extension of above step, sometimes additional values can be added to and then subtracted from the numerator to enable the single fraction to be split into two that intergtate more easily, for exmple $\\dfrac {x^2}{x^2+1} = \\dfrac{x^2+1-1}{x^2+1} = 1 - \\dfrac{1}{x^2+1}$\n",

    "#### Integration using partial fractions\n",
    "\n",
    "The degree of a polynomial expression in x is the highest power of x appearing in the expression. An algebraic fraction where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator is called a proper fraction (and vice versa for improper fractions)\n",
    "\n",
    "A proper fraction can be decomposed into simpler partial fractions which are easier to integrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that denominator is factorised as far as possible before applying the below:\n",

    "**Linear factors in the denominator with no repetition** <br>\n",

    "#### Integration by parts\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is useful for integrating expressions such as:\n",
    " - $\\ln x$\n",
    " - $ \\tan^{-1} x$\n",
    " - $ xe^x$\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses below formula which appears on the formula sheet: <br>\n",
    "$ {\\Large\\int} u \\dfrac{dv}{dx} dx=uv-{\\Large\\int}v \\dfrac {du}{dx}dx$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "When calculating a definite integral the \"bounds\" need to be applied to both the uv and the integral portion for example:\n",
    "<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration by parts can also be applied when it looks as if there is only one expression, for example $ {\\Large\\int} \\ln  x dx$ can be written as $ {\\Large\\int} (1) (\\ln  x) dx$ and then we can assign u=ln x and v'=1.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When integrating by parts use the LIATE rule in order to decide which expression to allocate to u to differentiate.  Assign in the below order:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Logarithmic functions e.g $\\ln x$, $\\log x$\n",
    " - Inverse trig functions\n",
    " - Algabraic functions e.g. $1$, $x$, $3x^2$\n",
    " - Trigonometric functions (excluding inverse included above)\n",
    " - Exponential functions e.g. $3^x$, $e^x$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible that multiple applications of integration by parts need to be performed in oder to arrive at a solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible for integration by parts to form a \"loop\" for example: <br>\n",
    "$ {\\Large\\int} \\text{<expression 1>} = \\text{expression 2 } - {\\Large\\int} \\text{<expression 1>} $, <br>\n",
    "then <br>\n",
    "$ {\\Large\\int} \\text{<expression 1>} = \\dfrac{1}{2} (\\text{expression 2 })$\n",
    "\n",
    "Above 2 cases tie into recurrence relations as below.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recurrence relations\n",
    "\n",
    "A recurrence relation is a recursive formula that expresses an integral in terms of a similiar integral with a smaller power.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example <br>\n",

    "$ {\\Large\\int} x^ne^{ax}dx = \\dfrac{1}{a}(x^ne^{ax}-n {\\Large\\int} x^{n-1}e^{ax}dx) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints\n",
    " - An integral such as $ {\\Large\\int} \\cos^nx $ can be restated as $ {\\Large\\int} \\cos^{n-1} x \\cos x dx$ and integration by parts can then be applied\n",
    "  - Not all recurrence relation questions rely on integration by parts\n"
