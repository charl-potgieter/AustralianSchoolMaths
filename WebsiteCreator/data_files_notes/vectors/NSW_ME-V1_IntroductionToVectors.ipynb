    "\n",
    " - Direction measured by $\\theta$, where $0^\\circ \\le \\theta \\le 360 ^\\circ$.   Note that $\\theta$ is never quoted as a negative given its domain.\n",
    "\n",
    " - $\\theta = \\dfrac{y}{x}$  Be careful as it is easy to get this the wrong way around given column vector notation quotes the x-value above the y-value.\n",

    " - Safest to draw a diagram when calculating $\\theta$ to ensure it's value is in the correct quadrant.  \n",

    " - Geometric proofs using vector examples\n",
    "\n",
    " - See formulas below for vectors parallel in like and unlike directions.  Also note vectors are parallel if one is a scalar multiple of another.\n",

    " - Acceleration due to gravity is the only acceleration that a projectile undergoes.  It can be subject to other velocity vectors though.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Note that it is useful to know below formulas but they cannot be used directly in any answers, they need to be derived from the gravity acceleration formula and the initial velocity formula\n",

    " - Note from above that the horizontal component of the velocity vector is independent of time t, whereas the horizontal component of the displacement vector is dependent on t.\n",

    " - In order to calculate the velocity vector of a projectile :\n",
    "    * Calculate the integral of the acceleration vector (where the variable of integtation is time = t).  The result includes a constant, say C\n",

    " - In order to calculate the displacement vector of a projectile :\n",
    "    * Calculate the integral of the velocity vector which includes a constant, say D.  The velocity vector is as calculated above.\n",
    "    * Get the displacement vector at time zero assuming horizontal component  = 0 = the start point and vertical component  = distance from vertical end point\n",
    "    *  Substitute the above equations into one another to solve for the constant D\n",

    " - Projectile calculation notes :\n",
    "    * Measure vertical displacement vector from where an object lands  - it should make no difference if measured from starting vertical point but ending vertical point is generally used if it is known\n",
    "    * Measure horizontal displacement vector from starting point that is starting point =  zero horizontal displacement.  This is done as we generally dont know the ending point but in theory doesnt make a difference and end point may have to be used depending on question.\n",
