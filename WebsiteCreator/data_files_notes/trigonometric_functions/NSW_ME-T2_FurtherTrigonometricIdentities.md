**Sum and difference expansions and double angles** <br>
The proofs of the sum and difference of angles such as $\sin(A+B)$ and $\tan(A-B)$ and following on that the double angles such as $\sin 2A$  etc all flow from the proof of $cos(A-B)$ which is proved via the unit circle and the cosine rule.

**t-formulas**<br>
The t-formulas express sin A, cos A, tan A in terms of t, where $t=\tan \frac{A}{2}$

Uses
 - a fraction in relevant format in terms of tan(the right hand side of a t-formula equation) can be converted into a simple sin, cos or tan function.
 - t-formulas can be utilised in integration (Year 12 Ext 2)

**Trigonometric products**
 - such as $\cos A \cos B = \dfrac{1}{2}[\cos(A-B) + \cos(A+B)]$

 - They are simple to prove by expanding the right hand side of the equation using the sum and difference expansions.
 
 - Note that the below 2 equations on the formula sheet are essentially the same, given the last portion of the second equation could be rewritten as  $+\sin(B-A)$.
    - $\sin A \cos B = \frac{1}{2}[\sin(A+B) + \sin(A-B)]$
    - $\cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2}[\sin(A+B) - \sin(A-B)]$
