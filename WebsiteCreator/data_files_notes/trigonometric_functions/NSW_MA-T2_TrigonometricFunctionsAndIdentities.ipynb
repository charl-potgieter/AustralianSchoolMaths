    "Note how $\\cot A = \\frac{\\cos A}{\\sin A}, \\sin A \\ne 0$, which is effectively $\\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{opposite}}$ **not** $\\frac{1}{\\tan A}$.  This is important as tan A is undefined at odd multiples of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ while cot A is zero.  This concept must also be understood when graphing cot A given that cot A has different assymptotes to tan A.\n",
