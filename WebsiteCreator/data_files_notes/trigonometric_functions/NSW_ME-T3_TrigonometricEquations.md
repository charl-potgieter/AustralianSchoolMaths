 **Auxiliary angles**

The auxiliary angle method can be utilsed to reduce an expression in the format $\pm a\cos x \pm b \sin x $ into $r \cos (x \pm \alpha)$ or $r \sin (x \pm \alpha)$.  In these scenarios, $\alpha$ is known as the auxiliary angle.

The above simpliciation can be useful in solving equations or sketching graphs.

Examples of auxiliary angles are incuded in the formulas below for example:<br>
$a \sin x + b \cos x = r \sin(x + \alpha) \text{, where } r=\sqrt{a^2+b^2} \text { and } \tan \alpha = \dfrac{b}{a}$

None of the auxiliary angles appear on the formula sheet so rather than attemping to memorise the below approach is recommended when say trying to solve a formula such as the above:
 - Expand the RHS of the equation using the compound angle rules that appear on the formula sheet, for example the $\sin (A+B)$ formula
 - The expanded right hand side will then equal something like $r\sin x \cos \alpha  + r \cos x \sin \alpha$
 - Comparing to LHS we can deduce that:
    - $r\cos \alpha  = a \therefore cos \alpha  =\frac{a}{r}$, and
    - $r\sin \alpha = b \therefore sin \alpha  =\frac{b}{r}$
 - sketching a right angled triangle:
   - r can be solved using the pythagoras theorem
   - $\alpha$ can be solved using $\tan \alpha = \frac{b}{a}$
