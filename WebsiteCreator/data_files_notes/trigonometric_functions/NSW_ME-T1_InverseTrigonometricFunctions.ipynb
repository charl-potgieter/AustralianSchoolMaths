    "The graph of an inverse function is a reflection of the original function in the line y=x.  (the y-value and x-values of the original graph are switched to obtain the inverse graph)\n",

    "The domain of the original function needs to be restricted before converting into the inverse fucntion to ensure that the result is a function, that is one value of y for each value of x.  This means that a horizontal line can cross the original function at only one point so that the inverse funciton passes a similar test with a vertical line.\n",
