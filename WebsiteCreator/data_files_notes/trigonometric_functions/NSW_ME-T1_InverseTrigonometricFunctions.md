The graph of an inverse function is a reflection of the original function in the line y=x.  (the y-value and x-values of the original graph are switched to obtain the inverse graph)

The domain of the original function needs to be restricted before converting into the inverse fucntion to ensure that the result is a function, that is one value of y for each value of x.  This means that a horizontal line can cross the original function at only one point so that the inverse funciton passes a similar test with a vertical line.

The domain of the orignal function becomes the range of the inverse and vice-versa.

**arcsin**
 - $y=sin^{-1}(x)$
 - domain = [-1,1]
 - range = $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$
 - Note no arrows at end of grpah as range is finite
 - It is an odd function, -f(x) = f(-x)

**arccos**
 - $y=cos^{-1}(x)$
 - domain = [-1,1]
 - range = $[0, \pi]$
 - Note no arrows at end of grpah as range is finite
 - It is neither odd nor even
 - The y-intercept of arccos is the x-intercept of cos = $\frac{\pi}{2}$

**arctan**
 - $y=tan^{-1}(x)$
 - domain = $(-\infty , \infty )$
 - range = $(-\frac{\pi}{2} , \frac{\pi}{2})$
 - infinite range, therefore arrows at end of graph
 - It is an odd function, -f(x) = f(-x)

Included in the formulas below requiring proof are the below 2 formulas.  Note that this reflects the fact that they are odd functions.
 - $\sin^{-1}(-x) = -\sin^{-1}x $
 - $\tan^{-1}(-x) = -\tan^{-1}x $
