### <span style="color:RGB(139,69,19)">  Notes </span>

 - Equivalence of complex numbers

 - Realising the denominator

 - Calculating the square of a complex number

 - Vectors of a complex number and its conjugate are reflections in  the real axis on an Argand diagram.

 - Add and subtract complex numbers utilising vector parallelogram rule

 - Multiply complex numbers by a constant

 - Tip: If a question provides 2 complex roots of a quadratic, it is simpler to substitute symbols for the roots such as a and b e.g. $(x-a)(x-b)  = 0$ and then multiply out before inserting the complex numbers

 - Be able to factorise a quadratic as a difference of squares by adding an $i^2$ to one of the sides in place of a minus one.  The real part of the square may need to be obtained by completing the square.

 - Complex numbers can be written in :
    * cartesian or rectangular form
    * polar of modulus-argument form
    * exponential form
 
 - Writing complex numbers in exponential form enables the use of index laws that can simplify calculations
