    "\n",
    " - Categorical data can be nominal or ordinal\n",
    "\n",
    " - Numerical data can be discrete or continuous\n",
    "\n",
    " - Displaying numerical data:\n",
    "    *Frequency table\n",
    "    * histogram (centre of column is lined up with value on x-axis.  No gap between columns) \n",
    "    * frequency polygon (line graph displaying frequency, starts and ends on x-axis) \n",
    "    * cumulative frequency histogram \n",
    "    * ogive (cumulative frequency polygon) \n",
    "    * stem and leaf plot [graphical display of tens (stems) and units (leaves)]\n",
    "    * dot plot\n",
    "    * five-number summary\n",
    "    * box plot (box-and-whisker-plot)\n",
    "\n",
    " - 3 Measures of central tendency:\n",
    "    * mean\n",
    "    * mode\n",
    "    * median\n",
    "\n",
    " - If ranges are provided in a frequency table a class centre will generally need to be added as an additional column in order to calculate statistics such as mean, standard deviation etc.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Grouped data has a modal class rather than a mode\n",
    "\n",
    " - If there are two middle values. In other words an even number of values, the median is the average of these values.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The median on an ogive is the halfway point on the cumulative frequency axis\n",
    "\n",
    " - Recommended, but not universal, method for computing quartiles:\n",
    "    * Use the median to divide the ordered set into 2 halves.  \n",
    "    * If there is an odd number in the original set then do not include the median in either half.\n",
    "    * If there is an even number in the original set then split the set exactly in half\n",
    "    * Q1 and Q3 are the medians of the lower and upper halves respectively\n",
    "\n",
    " - Quantile is a general term, quartiles divide set into 4 parts, deciles into 10 parts and percentiles into 100 parts\n",
    " - Shapes of data: \n",
    "    * negatively skewed = more area to left of the centre = the tail points to low scores\n",
    "    * positively skewed = more area to the right of the centre = the tail points to high scores\n",
    "    * symmetrical\n",
    "\n",
    " - Modality of data:\n",
    "    * unimodal  = 1 peak\n",
    "    * bimodal  = 2 peaks\n",
    "    * multimodal = has many peaks\n",
    " \n",
    " - Scatterplots are used to graph bivariate data\n",
    "\n",
    " - Scatterplots can be:\n",
    "    * linear\n",
    "    * non-linear\n",
    "    * have no shape\n",
    " \n",
    " - Don't need to utilise a formula to calculate Pearson's correlation co-efficient (r) but need to be able to calculate using calculator\n",
    "\n",
    " - Values of  Pearson's correlation co-efficient (r):\n",
    "    * $ -1 \\le r \\le 1$\n",
    "    * $ 0 \\le r \\le 1$ &emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;  scatterplot with positive direction\n",
    "    * $r=1$ &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; perfect positive correlation \n",
    "    * $ -1 \\le r \\le 0$ &ensp;&nbsp; scatterplot with negative direction \n",
    "    * $r=-1$ &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; perfect negative correlation\n",
    "    * $r=0$ &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; no correlation\n",
    " \n",
    " - Need to be able to calculate least squares regression line on a calculator but donâ€™t need to be able to manually calculate with formula\n"
