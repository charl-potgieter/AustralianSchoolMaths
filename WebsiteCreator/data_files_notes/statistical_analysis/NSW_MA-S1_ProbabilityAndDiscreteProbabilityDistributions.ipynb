    " - Probability trees: Use the product rule along branches to find $P( A \\cap B )$   representing A and B\n",
    "\n",
    " - Probability trees: Use the additional rule for different branches to find $P(A \\cup B) $ representing A or B.\n",
    "\n",
    " - $A \\cup B $ is A union B\n",
    "\n",
    " - $A \\cap B $  is A intersection B\n",
    "\n",
    " - The probability formula applies where each outcome is equally likely: $ P(E) = \\dfrac{n(E)}{n(S)} $\n",
    "\n",
    " - The sum of all mutually exclusive probabilities is 1\n",
    "\n",
    " - $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) $ is the addition rule for mutually exclusive events\n",
    "\n",
    " - $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) $ is the addition rule \n",

    " - $P(A \\cap B)  = P(A)P(B)$ is the product rule for independent events only\n",
    "\n",
    " - Conditional probability is $ P(A|B) = \\dfrac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\text{, where } P(B) eq 0 $ while conditional probability for independent events is $ P(A|B) = P(A) $\n",

    " - Capital letter, e.g. X is often used for a random variable\n",
    "\n",
    " - Lower case letter such as x is used for the values of X\n",
    "\n",
    " - Properties of discrete probability distributions:\n",
    "    * All possible value of X are mutually exclusive\n",
    "    * The sum of probabilities = 1\n",
    "    * For each value of x: 0<=P(X=x)<=1\n",
    "\n",
    " - A probability distribution can be drawn as a table with columns for x and P$($x$)$\n",
    "\n",
    " - The expected values E(X) of a probability distribution measures the centre of the distribution  = mean or average\n",
    " - $\\overline{x} $ is the mean of a sample\n",
    "\n",
    " - $\\mu $ is the mean of the population\n",
    "\n",
    " - $s$ is the sample standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    " - $\\sigma$ is the poplulation standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    " - As the sample size increases $\\overline{x} $ approaches  $\\mu $\n",
    "\n",
    " - The complement of A can be written as $\\overline A$ or $ \\text{A'}$ or $A^c$\n",
    "\n",
    " - The formula sheet defines variance as follows:  $ Var(X) = E(X^2) - \\mu^2$.  The following may be an easier format to understand though: $ Var(X) = \\sum[x^2p(x)] - \\mu^2$\n",
