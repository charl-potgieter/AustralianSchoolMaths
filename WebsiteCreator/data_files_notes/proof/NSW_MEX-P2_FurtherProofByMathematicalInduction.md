 - divisibility
 - induction
 - recursive formula
 - series
 - sigma notation





###   Notes 


#### Proof of divisibility
If X is divisible by Y then X = pY for some $P \in \mathbb{N}$

#### Further mathematical induction
Proving propositions that are only true for a subset of integer values n such as 
 - $ n \ge \text {some value}$
 - odd integers
 - even integers

#### Series and sigma notation

$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^n T_r - T_1 + T_2 + T_3+...+T_n$

RTP = required to prove

Tip: Sequences that alternate between positive and negative can be prefixed by $(-1)^r$

#### Applications of mathematical induction

Below are examples of results that can be ussed in inequality proofs:
 
 - if a>b then a-b >0

 - if a>b and b>c then a>c

 - if a>b and c>d then a+c>b+d

 - if a,b,c > 0  and a>b then ac>bc
 
 - if a>b>0 then $\dfrac{1}{a}<\dfrac{1}{b}$


#### Recursive proofs
 - Recursive formulas: An item  in a sequence is defined in terms of the precvious item in the sequence.

 - Induction can be utilised to prove a recursive formula in terms of n (without referencing the previous term in the sequence)

 - Tip: When assuming  P(k) is true, it is also assumed that P(k-1), P(k-2) and earlier are true.  It is only the next item that needs to be proven, e.g P(k+1) or say P(k+2) for odd or even numbers



#### Proofs involving inequalities and graphs
Graphs can be utlised when inequalities are difficult to solve  algebraically.
