    "#### Proof of divisibility\n",
    "If X is divisible by Y then X = pY for some $P \\in \\mathbb{N}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further mathematical induction\n",
    "Proving propositions that are only true for a subset of integer values n such as \n",
    " - $ n \\ge \\text {some value}$\n",
    " - odd integers\n",
    " - even integers\n",

    "#### Series and sigma notation\n",

    "$\\displaystyle \\sum_{n=1}^n T_r - T_1 + T_2 + T_3+...+T_n$\n",

    "Tip: Sequences that alternate between positive and negative can be prefixed by $(-1)^r$\n",

    "#### Applications of mathematical induction\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are examples of results that can be ussed in inequality proofs:\n",
    " \n",
    " - if a>b then a-b >0\n",
    "\n",
    " - if a>b and b>c then a>c\n",
    "\n",
    " - if a>b and c>d then a+c>b+d\n",
    "\n",
    " - if a,b,c > 0  and a>b then ac>bc\n",
    " \n",
    " - if a>b>0 then $\\dfrac{1}{a}<\\dfrac{1}{b}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recursive proofs\n",
    " - Recursive formulas: An item  in a sequence is defined in terms of the precvious item in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Induction can be utilised to prove a recursive formula in terms of n (without referencing the previous term in the sequence)\n",
    "\n",
    " - Tip: When assuming  P(k) is true, it is also assumed that P(k-1), P(k-2) and earlier are true.  It is only the next item that needs to be proven, e.g P(k+1) or say P(k+2) for odd or even numbers\n",

    "#### Proofs involving inequalities and graphs\n",
    "Graphs can be utlised when inequalities are difficult to solve  algebraically. \n"
