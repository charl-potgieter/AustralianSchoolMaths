    " - Can be utilised to prove a statement true for all positive integers, n\n",
    "\n",
    " - Step 1: Show that the statement is true for n=1\n",
    "\n",
    " - Step 2: Assume that the statement is true for some positive integer n = k\n",
    "\n",
    " - Step 3: Using the assumption prove that the statement is also true for the next integer n=k+1\n",
    "\n",
    " - Conclusion: State why the statement is true for all positive integers $n \\ge 1$  Don't forget this!\n",
    "\n",
    " - The conclusion can look like this :\n",
    "    * The statement is true for n=k+1\n",
    "    * The statement is true for n=1\n",
    "    * Therefore by mathematical induction it is true for all integers $n \\ge 1$\n"
