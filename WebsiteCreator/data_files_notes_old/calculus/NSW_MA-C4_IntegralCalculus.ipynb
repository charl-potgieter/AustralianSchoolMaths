    "When sketching a derivative graph:\n",
    " - the x-intercepts are where the original function has a stationary point\n",
    " - Where the derivative graph is above the x-axis, the original graph has a positive gradient and vice versa.\n",
    " - The anti-derivative represents a family of curves unless a point on the curve is specified.\n",
    "\n",
    " When solving integration questions be on the lookout for equations in the below formats or or equations that can be factored into these patterns:\n",
    "  -  $f'(x)[f(x)]^n$ \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - $\\dfrac{f'(x)}{f((x))}$\n",
    "\n",
    "  **NB** The trig integral rules work on radians, not degrees. If a question is in degrees it first needs to be converted into radians.  Convert back to degrees in final step if required.\n",

    "  Capital letters are often used as convention for the integral / anti-derivatve function, for example if f(x) is the function F(x) is the anti-derivative.\n",

    "  The area enclosed by a curve y=f(x), the x-axis and lines x=a and x=b is given by $\\int_a^b f(x)dx = F(b)-F(a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "  When calculating the area between a curve and the x-axis:\n",
    "   - best to first sketch the curve and deterimine the x-intercepts\n",
    "   - areas above and below the x-axis need to be calculated seperately, and there absolute values summed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a question asks to calculate the area bounded by a curve and either x or y axis, it is the area between the curve and the axis intercepts.  For example it could be something like the shaded sections below.\n",
