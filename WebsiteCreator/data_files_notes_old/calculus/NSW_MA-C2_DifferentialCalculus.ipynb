    "Refer formulas below (the non-chain rule versions).  Note cases requiring proof.\n",

    "**NB** The trig derivative rules work on radians, not degrees.  If a question is in degrees it first needs to be converted into radians.  Convert back to degrees in final step if required.\n",

    "#### Rules of differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply product, quotient and chain rules to differentiate the \"simpler\" versions of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular note that $\\tan x$ can be converted to $\\dfrac{sin x}{cos x}$ and the quotient rule can then be applied.  Similiarly the quotient rule can be used to calculate $\\sec x$ and $\\cosec x$ by converting these into $\\frac{1}{cos x}$ and $\\frac{1}{sin x}$ respectively.\n",
