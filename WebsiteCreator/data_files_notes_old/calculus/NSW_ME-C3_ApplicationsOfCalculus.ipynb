    " \n",
    "Volumes formed by rotation about the x-axis = $V=\\pi \\int_a^b y^2 dx$\n",
    " - The volume calculated is between the curves and point a and b on the x-axis, as the curve is rotated around the x-axis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Volumes formed by rotation about the y-axis = $V=\\pi \\int_a^b x^2 dy$\n",
    "- The volume calculated is between the curves and point a and b on the y-axis, as the curve is rotated around the y-axis\n",
    " - If a question provides 2 points on the x-axis, the a and b values on the y-axis need to be calculated by using the original function formula.\n",
    "\n",
    " <span style=\"color:RGB(255,0,0)\">  Can above formulas be used directly in questions or do they need to be derived.  They do not appear on the formula sheet or in the syllabus  </span>\n",
    "\n",
    " Remember to specify $\\text{units}^3$ when providing a volume answer if no other specific measure e.g. cm is provided in the question.\n",

    "\n",
    " #### Differential equations\n",
    "\n",
    " Be able to sketch direction fields / slope fields\n",
    "\n",
    " **Solving differential equations in the form $\\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x)$**\n",
    " - The solution is an equation on the format of y=f(x)\n",
    " \n",
    " - This involves finding the integral (anti-derivative)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    " \n",
    " **Solving differential equations in the form $\\frac{dy}{dx}=g(y)$**\n",
    " - Note how the derivative \"denominator\" is x but function g is defined in terms of y.\n",
    "\n",
    " - This equation can be interpreted as \"the gradient of y=f(x) is a function of it's y-value, that is the gradient can be determined if a y-value is provided\"\n",
    "\n",
    " - The same as above, these problems involve finding a solution equation on the format of y=f(x)\n",
    "\n",
    " - Need to use the fact that $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\dfrac{1}{\\frac{dx}{dy}}$, that is invert g(y) and calculate $\\frac{dx}{dy}$ which will provide an equation in the format x=f(y)\n",
    "\n",
    " - As a final step make y the subject of the above equation.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Be on on the lookout for derivative \"denominators\" that don't match the variable in the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    " **Solving differential equations in the form $\\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x)g(y)$**\n",
    "\n",
    " - This equation can be interpreted as \"the gradient of y=f(x) is a function of both it's x and y-value\"\n",
    "\n",
    " - These equations can sometimes be solved by the separation of variables which places the y's on the left and x's on the right, that is: $\\dfrac{1}{g(y)}dy = f(x)dx$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both sides can then be integrated\n",
    "\n",
    "- Not all differential equations are separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exponential Growth and Decay**\n",
    "\n",
    " - Exponential growth and decay equations covered in Year 11, ext 1 are first-order linear differential equations, effectively in the format $\\frac{dy}{dx}=g(y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Equation**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a more realistic model than the exponential growth and decay which restricts the population to a maximum level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Population is a function of time, that is P(t) and $\\frac{dP}{dt}$ represents the instantaneous rate of change of the population at a specific time\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 1: $\\frac{dP}{dt} = kP(N-P)$ <br><br>\n",
    "Option 2: $\\frac{dP}{dt} = kP(1-\\frac{P}{N})$, where \n",
    " - t is time\n",
    " - k is the growth rate\n",
    " - P is population\n",
    " - N is the limiting condition or carrying capacity (defined to be the maximum population of that organism that the environment can sustain indefinitely)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the first part of above equations, $\\frac{dP}{dt} = kP$, is the simple expononential growth and decay equation (although the later tends to use the symbol N instead of P).  In both options above kP is then multiplied by a factor which results in the rate of change ceasing once a limit  is reached.\n",
