    " - Understand the transformation of functions in the form y=kf(a(x+b))+c, where f(x) is a trigonometric function such as sin x, cos x etc.\n",
    " - Be able to determine the domain and range of the transformed function\n",
    " - The impact of the transforation on amplitude, phase and center are set out in Year 11 Advanced, Trigonometric Functions.\n",
    " - Note that amplitude is a measure from centre to top (or bottom) of graph.  NOT top to bottom.\n",
    " - Note that domain refers to the values that can be allocated to $x$.  For example if $y=\\sin 3x$ has a domain of $[0, \\pi]$ tht means that $3x$ will have values between $0$ and $3\\pi$"
